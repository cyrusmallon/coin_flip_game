# Random Forest Example

This code is based on an example I saw here <https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2> that attempts to explain exactly what a random forest model does. It's a very simple example and thus a good teaching tool. I will add more detail to the document and perhaps use it for future teaching purposes. 

This example is, by default, also a very simple explanation of a Monte Carlo simulation, where you have a model and chose a random value for a parameter across many trials. 

See the Notebook for more details.
